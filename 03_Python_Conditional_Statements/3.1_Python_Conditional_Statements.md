# Conditional Statements in Python

Conditional statements allow a program to **make decisions** based on conditions.

They execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is True or False.

---

## `if` Statement

The `if` statement runs a block of code only if the condition is True.

```python
x = 10

if x > 5:
    print("Greater than 5")
```

If the condition evaluates to False, nothing happens.

Python uses indentation to define blocks.

---

## `if–else` Statement

Used when you want two possible outcomes.

```python
x = 3

if x > 5:
    print("Greater")
else:
    print("Smaller or equal")
```

* If condition is True → `if` block runs.
* Otherwise → `else` block runs.

Only one block executes.

---

## `if–elif–else` (Else If)

Python uses `elif` instead of "else if".

Used when multiple conditions need to be checked.

```python
x = 0

if x > 0:
    print("Positive")
elif x < 0:
    print("Negative")
else:
    print("Zero")
```

Execution flow:

* Python checks conditions from top to bottom.
* The first True condition runs.
* Remaining conditions are skipped.
* If none are True → `else` runs (if present).

---

##  Nested `if`

An `if` inside another `if`.

```python
x = 10

if x > 5:
    if x < 20:
        print("Between 5 and 20")
```

Used when decisions depend on previous decisions.

# Switch Statement in Python

Python **does not have a traditional switch statement** like C, C++, or Java.

However, there are alternatives.

---

## Using `if–elif–else`

```python
day = 2

if day == 1:
    print("Monday")
elif day == 2:
    print("Tuesday")
elif day == 3:
    print("Wednesday")
else:
    print("Invalid day")
```

This works like a switch.

---

## Method 2: Using Dictionary (Cleaner Alternative)
we will study it in the dictionary module.



---

## Method 3: `match-case` (Python 3.10+)

From Python 3.10, Python introduced structural pattern matching.

```python
day = 2

match day:
    case 1:
        print("Monday")
    case 2:
        print("Tuesday")
    case _:
        print("Invalid")
```

This is the closest equivalent to a real switch statement.

`case _` works like default.

---

# Important Points

* Conditions must evaluate to True or False.
* Python uses indentation (not braces).
* Execution stops after the first matching condition.
* Avoid very long `if–elif` chains when dictionary or match-case is better.

---

# Common Mistakes

Forgetting indentation
Using assignment `=` instead of comparison `==`
Writing unnecessary comparisons like:

```python
if x == True:   # Avoid
```

Better:

```python
if x:
```

---

# Summary

* `if` → single condition
* `if–else` → two outcomes
* `if–elif–else` → multiple conditions
* Python has no traditional switch
* Use `match-case` (3.10+) for switch-like behavior
