# Loops in Python — Notes

Loops let you repeat a block of code multiple times.

Python mainly has:

```
for loop
while loop
```

---

#  `for` Loop

Used when you know **what to iterate over** (sequence, range, string, list, etc.).

Basic syntax:

```python
for variable in iterable:
    # code
```

Example:

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

Output:

```
0 1 2 3 4
```

---

##  `range()` Function (Very Important)

`range()` generates numbers.

```
range(stop)
range(start, stop)
range(start, stop, step)
```

Examples:

```python
range(5)        # 0,1,2,3,4
range(1,5)      # 1,2,3,4
range(1,10,2)   # 1,3,5,7,9
```

---

##  Looping over String

```python
for ch in "python":
    print(ch)
```

Each character is visited one by one.

---

##  Loop Variable Scope

The loop variable remains after loop ends:

```python
for i in range(3):
    pass

print(i)   # 2
```

---

#  `while` Loop

Used when repetition depends on a condition.

Syntax:

```python
while condition:
    # code
```

Example:

```python
i = 0
while i < 3:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

Always update the condition variable — otherwise infinite loop.

---

#  Infinite Loop

```python
while True:
    print("running")
```

Runs forever unless broken.

---

## Loop Control Statements



### `break`

Stops loop immediately.

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)
```

Output:

```
0 1 2
```

---

### `continue`

Skip current iteration, go to next.

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue
    print(i)
```

Output:

```
0 1 3 4
```

---

### `pass`

Does nothing — placeholder.

```python
for i in range(3):
    pass
```

---

### `else` with Loops 

`else` runs only if loop finishes normally.

```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop finished")
```

If `break` happens → else does NOT run.

---

## Nested Loops

Loop inside another loop.

```python
for i in range(2):
    for j in range(3):
        print(i, j)
```

---

## Iteration vs Indexing

Python prefers:

```python
for ch in string:
```

Instead of:

```python
for i in range(len(string)):
```

Cleaner and safer.

---

## Common Mistakes

##  Forgetting to update variable in `while`

```python
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)   # infinite loop
```

---

##  Modifying iterable while looping

Can cause unexpected behavior.

---

## Using loop when built-in exists

Example:

```python
sum(nums)   # better than manual loop
```

---

#  Summary

```
for      → iteration over sequence
while    → condition based repetition
range()  → generates numbers
break    → stop loop
continue → skip iteration
pass     → placeholder
else     → runs if no break
```
