# Booleans

## What are Booleans in Python?

In Python, a Boolean is a data type that represents **True or False**.

Python has a built-in type:

`bool`

There are only two Boolean values:

* `True`
* `False`

Internally, they are instances of the `bool` class.

```python
x = True
y = False
```

---

## How are Booleans stored in Python?

Here’s something interesting:

In CPython (the standard Python implementation):

* `bool` is a subclass of `int`.

That means:

```python
True == 1   # True
False == 0  # True
```

Internally:

* `True` behaves like integer `1`
* `False` behaves like integer `0`

But they are singletons — only **one instance of True and False exists in memory**.

```python
True is True     # True
False is False   # True
```

Memory-wise:

* They are small immutable objects.
* Stored like integers.
* Implemented in C as `PyBoolObject`.

---

## Truthy and Falsy Values

Python doesn’t require explicit boolean values in conditions.

It evaluates objects as **truthy** or **falsy**.

### Falsy values:

These evaluate to `False`:

* `False`
* `None`
* `0`
* `0.0`
* `0j`
* `""` (empty string)
* `[]` (empty list)
* `{}` (empty dict)
* `set()`
* `range(0)`

Example:

```python
if "":
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")   # This runs
```

### Truthy values:

Anything that is **not falsy** is truthy.

```python
if [1, 2]:
    print("Truthy")
```

---

## Comparison Operators

These compare values and return booleans.

| Operator | Meaning          |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| `==`     | Equal            |
| `!=`     | Not equal        |
| `>`      | Greater than     |
| `<`      | Less than        |
| `>=`     | Greater or equal |
| `<=`     | Less or equal    |

Example:

```python
5 > 3   # True
5 == 5  # True
```

Chained comparisons are allowed:

```python
1 < x < 10
```

This is internally equivalent to:

```python
(1 < x) and (x < 10)
```

---

## Logical Operators in Python

Python has 3 logical operators:

### `and`

Returns True if both are True.

```python
True and True   # True
```

### `or`

Returns True if at least one is True.

```python
True or False   # True
```

### `not`

Negates the value.

```python
not True   # False
```

Important:
`and` and `or` return actual operands, not just True/False.

```python
5 and 10   # 10
0 and 10   # 0
5 or 10    # 5
0 or 10    # 10
```

This is extremely important for understanding short-circuiting.

---

## What is Short Circuiting?

Short-circuiting means:

👉 Python stops evaluating as soon as the result is determined.

### With `and`

If the first value is falsy → it stops.

```python
False and something()
```

Python never calls `something()`.

Because result is already False.

### With `or`

If the first value is truthy → it stops.

```python
True or something()
```

`someting()` never runs.

---

### Example:

```python
def test():
    print("Executed")
    return True

False and test()   # test() not executed
True or test()     # test() not executed
```

Why?

Because evaluation is left → right.

---

## Common Pitfalls

###  1. Comparing with True explicitly

Bad:

```python
if x == True:
```

Good:

```python
if x:
```

---

### 2. Misunderstanding `and/or` return values

```python
result = a and b
```

This does NOT return True/False necessarily.

It returns:

* First falsy value
* Or last truthy value

---

### 3. Empty containers in conditions

```python
if my_list:
```

This checks if list is not empty.

---

### 4. Using `or` for default values (edge case)

```python
value = user_input or "default"
```

If user_input is `0`, it will wrongly give `"default"`.

Because `0` is falsy.

---

## Internal Execution (Deep Understanding)

When Python evaluates:

```python
if x:
```

Internally it calls:

```
PyObject_IsTrue(x)
```

Python checks in this order:

1. Does object have `__bool__()`?

   * If yes → call it.
2. Else does it have `__len__()`?

   * If length == 0 → False
3. Otherwise → True

Example:

```python
class A:
    def __bool__(self):
        return False
```

Now:

```python
if A():
    print("Yes")
```

Nothing prints.

Because `__bool__()` returned False.

---

### Internally for `and`:

For:

```python
a and b
```

Python:

1. Evaluate `a`
2. If `a` is falsy → return `a`
3. Else → evaluate and return `b`

---

### Internally for `or`:

1. Evaluate `a`
2. If `a` is truthy → return `a`
3. Else → evaluate and return `b`

---

## Summary

* `bool` is subclass of `int`
* `True = 1`, `False = 0`
* Truthiness decided by `__bool__()` or `__len__()`
* `and` / `or` return operands, not booleans
* Short-circuiting stops early
* Be careful with default values using `or`
* Avoid `== True`
