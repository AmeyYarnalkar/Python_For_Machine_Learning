# Python Strings 


## What is a String in Python?

A **string** is a sequence of characters stored as text.

In Python, strings are:

* ordered
* immutable (cannot change individual characters)
* indexed

Examples:

```
"hello"
"Python123"
"@#%"
```

You can use:

```
"double quotes"
'single quotes'
'''multi line'''
```

##  Creating Strings

### Empty String

```
s = ""
```

or

```
s = str()
```

---

### Filled String

```
name = "Jarvis"
msg = 'Hello World'
```

---

### Convert Anything into String

```
str(10)        → "10"
str(3.14)      → "3.14"
str(True)      → "True"
```

Python converts values into their text representation.

---

##  Checking Type

Use `type()`:

```
type("hello")   → <class 'str'>
```

Useful when debugging mixed data.

---

##  Length of String

Use `len()`:

```
len("python") → 6
```

Counts total characters including spaces.

---

## String Indexing (0-Based)

Python uses **0-based indexing**.

Range:

```
0  to  len(string) - 1
```

Example:

```
s = "python"

s[0] → 'p'
s[1] → 'y'
s[5] → 'n'
```

Negative indexing also works:

```
s[-1] → 'n'
s[-2] → 'o'
```

---

##  String Comparison (Unicode Order)

Python compares strings using **Unicode values**.

Order roughly behaves like:

```
numbers < uppercase letters < lowercase letters
```

### Example

```
"100" < "ABC"    → True
"ABC" < "abc"    → True
"a" > "Z"        → True
```

Why?

Because Unicode value of:

```
'1'  < 'A'  < 'a'
```

Python compares character by character from left to right.

---

## Membership Checking

Check if a character or substring exists:

```
"a" in "cat"        → True
"z" in "cat"        → False
```

Negation:

```
"x" not in "hello"
```

---

## Important String Operations


###  Indexing

Access single character:

```
s = "hello"
s[1] → 'e'
```

Remember: strings are immutable — you cannot change using index.

---

### Slicing

Get part of a string:

```
s[start:end]
```

Example:

```
s = "python"

s[0:2] → "py"
s[2:5] → "tho"
s[:3]  → "pyt"
s[3:]  → "hon"
```

End index is excluded.

---

### Concatenation

Join strings using `+`:

```
"hello" + " " + "world"
```

Result:

```
"hello world"
```

---

### Changing Case

```
s.lower()
s.upper()
s.title()
s.capitalize()
```

Example:

```
"python".upper() → "PYTHON"
```

---

### Removing Extra Spaces

```
s.strip()     # both sides
s.lstrip()    # left only
s.rstrip()    # right only
```

Example:

```
"  hi  ".strip() → "hi"
```

---

### Finding Substring or Character

```
s.find("a")
s.index("a")
```

---

### Difference Between `find()` and `index()`

#### `find()`

```
"hello".find("z") → -1
```

Returns `-1` if not found.

---

#### `index()`

```
"hello".index("z")
```

Raises an **error** if not found.

👉 Use `find()` when unsure.
👉 Use `index()` when you expect it to exist.

---

### Splitting String into List

```
s.split(delimiter)
```

Example:

```
"one,two,three".split(",")
```

Result:

```
["one", "two", "three"]
```

Default delimiter = space.

```
"a b c".split()
```

---

### Joining List into String

```
delimiter.join(list)
```

Example:

```
"-".join(["2026","02","14"])
```

Result:

```
"2026-02-14"
```

Important:

👉 delimiter comes before `.join()`.

---

## Important Reality About Strings

* Strings are **immutable**.
* Operations create new strings instead of changing original.

Example:

```
s = "hello"
s.upper()
```

Original `s` stays `"hello"` unless reassigned.
