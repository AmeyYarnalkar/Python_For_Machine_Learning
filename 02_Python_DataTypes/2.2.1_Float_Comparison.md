# Comparing Floating-Point Numbers in Python

##  Why direct comparison is unreliable

Floats are stored in **binary**, not normal decimal form.
Many decimal numbers like `0.1` or `0.2` cannot be represented exactly, so Python stores a very close approximation.

Because of this:

```
0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3   # may be False
```

The values look the same to us, but internally there is a tiny precision difference.

👉 So using `==` for floats often fails even when the numbers *seem* equal.

---

##  The Core Idea — “Almost Equal” Instead of Exact Equal

Instead of checking if two floats are exactly the same, we check:

```
Are they close enough?
```

This is done using **tolerance** — a small acceptable difference.

## Correct Ways to Compare Floats



## Using `math.isclose()` (Recommended)

Python provides a built-in way to compare floats safely.

```
import math

math.isclose(a, b)
```

### How it works

It checks if the difference between numbers is small enough using two rules:

### Relative tolerance (`rel_tol`)

* Compares difference as a percentage of the larger value.
* Useful when numbers are large or vary in size.

### Absolute tolerance (`abs_tol`)

* Fixed small difference.
* Useful when numbers are near zero.

👉 This method is simple and works for most real situations.

## Manual Tolerance Check

If you want full control or are using older Python versions:

```
abs(a - b) < 1e-9 # 0.000000001
```

Here:

```
1e-9
```

is the tolerance (epsilon).

### When to use

* Custom precision requirements
* Performance-sensitive code
* Very specific comparisons

You must choose the tolerance carefully depending on your use case.
