### Interning of Numbers and Strings in Python 

**Interning** means Python stores only **one copy** of certain immutable objects and reuses it wherever possible to save memory and improve speed.

## Interning of Numbers

In CPython:

* Small integers (usually from **-5 to 256**) are automatically interned.
* That means Python pre-creates these integers and reuses them.

Example:

```python
a = 100
b = 100

a is b   # True
```

But:

```python
a = 1000
b = 1000

a is b   # May be False (implementation dependent)
```

So small integers are cached, large ones usually are not.

---

##  Interning of Strings

Python interns:

* Short strings
* Identifiers (variable names)
* Some string literals at compile time

Example:

```python
a = "hello"
b = "hello"

a is b   # Often True
```

But dynamically created strings may not be interned:

```python
a = "hello world"
b = "hello " + "world"   # compile-time optimization

a is b   # Often True

c = "hello " + input()   # runtime creation
```

Runtime-created strings are usually not interned automatically.

You can force interning:

```python
import sys
sys.intern("some_string")
```

## Why Python Does This

* Saves memory
* Makes comparisons faster
* Allows fast dictionary lookups

---

## Care We Need to Take 

### Don’t use `is` for value comparison

Wrong:

```python
a = 1000
b = 1000
if a is b:   # Not reliable
```

Correct:

```python
if a == b:
```

`is` checks identity (same memory),
`==` checks value.

---

### Don’t rely on interning behavior

Interning rules can:

* Change between Python versions
* Differ across implementations (CPython, PyPy)

So never write logic that depends on:

```python
a is b
```

for numbers or strings.

---

## When is `is` Correct?

Use `is` only for:

```python
if x is None:
```

Because `None` is a singleton.

---

## Final Idea

Interning is an **optimization technique** where Python reuses immutable objects like small integers and some strings to improve memory efficiency and speed.

But as a programmer:

👉 Always compare values using `==`
👉 Use `is` only for identity checks like `None`
