# How Python Stores Data in Variables 

Before writing programs, understand one core idea:

👉 Python variables do NOT store actual data.
👉 They store a **reference** to data (an object) created in memory.

This is the biggest mindset shift compared to some other languages.

## How Python Stores Data in a Variable

When you write:

```
x = 10
```

Python does three things internally:

1. Creates an object `10` in memory.
2. Assigns the type `int` to that object.
3. Makes the variable name `x` point to that object.

So the real situation is:

```
x  ─────►  10 (object in memory)
```

The variable is just a label, not a container.

## How Variables Access Data

Whenever you use a variable:

```
print(x)
```

Python follows this process:

1. Looks for the name `x`.
2. Finds which object it refers to.
3. Accesses the value stored in that object.
4. Performs the operation.

Python always works through references, not raw memory values.

## Basic Syntax to Implement Variables

## creating a Variable

```
x = 5
name = "Amey"
marks = [10,20,30]
```

General pattern:

```
variable_name = value
```

Left side → variable name
Right side → object creation

---

## Multiple Assignments

```
a = b = 10
```

Both names point to the same object.

---

## Updating a Variable

```
x = 10
x = 20
```

Python does NOT modify 10.
It creates a new object 20 and redirects `x`.

# Rules for Variables in Python

## Naming Rules

* Must start with a letter or underscore `_`
* Cannot start with a number
* No spaces allowed
* Case-sensitive

Valid:

```
age
_age
score1
```

Invalid:

```
1age
user name
```

---

## Assignment Rules

* No type declaration needed.
* Python decides the type automatically.

```
x = 10      # int
x = "hi"    # now string
```

This is called dynamic typing.

---

## One Name Can Point to Any Object

```
x = 10
x = [1,2,3]
```

Same variable, different object.

Python allows this flexibility.
