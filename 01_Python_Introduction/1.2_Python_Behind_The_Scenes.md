# How Python Works Internally 

## Step One — You Write Code and Hit Run

When you write a `.py` file and execute it:

* You are giving **high-level instructions** written in human-readable
  syntax.
* Computers cannot understand this directly.
* So Python first converts your code into an intermediate form before
  execution.

👉 Important:
Python is **not fully compiled like C++** and **not purely interpreted**.
It uses a **hybrid model**.

---

## Step Two — Compilation to Bytecode

### What is Bytecode?

Bytecode is:

* A **low-level, platform-independent instruction set**
* Not machine code
* Not human-readable source code

Think of it as:

```
Your Code (English-like)
        ↓
   Bytecode (Python instructions)
        ↓
 Machine Execution
```

Example idea:

```
print("Hello")
```

gets converted into small internal instructions like:

```
LOAD_NAME
LOAD_CONST
CALL_FUNCTION
```

---

###  Why Convert to Bytecode?

Python converts code to bytecode because:

* It makes execution faster than interpreting raw text every time.
* It allows Python to run on different operating systems without
  recompiling for each CPU.
* It simplifies execution for the Python Virtual Machine (PVM).

In short:

👉 Bytecode = optimized instructions for Python’s engine.

---

### Where is Bytecode Stored?

Usually inside:

```
__pycache__/filename.cpython-XX.pyc
```

These `.pyc` files contain compiled bytecode.

Python may create them automatically when:

* You import a module
* Or sometimes when running scripts

---

###  Can We See Bytecode?

Yes — using the `dis` module:

```
import dis
dis.dis(function_name)
```

This shows Python instructions generated from your code.\
>Ignore the syntax we will learn in the upcoming modules.

---

###  What Happens if You Change the Code?

If source code changes:

* Python detects modification time.
* Old bytecode becomes invalid.
* Python recompiles and generates new bytecode.

So you don’t manually manage compilation — Python handles it.

---

## Step Three — Python Virtual Machine (PVM)

###  What is the Python Virtual Machine?

The PVM is:

👉 The engine that **executes bytecode instruction by instruction**.

It is NOT a separate app you install.

It is already inside:

* CPython interpreter
* Embedded within Python runtime.

---

###  Where is PVM Present?

Inside the Python interpreter executable.

Example:

```
python.exe (Windows)
python (Linux/Mac)
```

The interpreter contains:

* Compiler → creates bytecode
* PVM → executes bytecode

---

###  Why is PVM Needed?

Because:

* Bytecode is still not CPU machine code.
* The PVM translates bytecode into real actions.

Responsibilities:

* Memory handling
* Object creation
* Function calls
* Execution flow

Without PVM:

👉 Bytecode is useless.

---

## Final Step — Output Generation

After execution:

* Results are printed
* Files are modified
* Calculations complete

The user only sees final output, but internally:

```
Source Code → Bytecode → PVM Execution → Output
```

---

## Compile Time vs Run Time

###  Compile Time (in Python)

In Python, compile time means:

* Source code converted into bytecode.
* Syntax errors appear here.

Example errors:

```
missing colon
wrong indentation
invalid syntax
```

This happens BEFORE execution starts.

---

###  Run Time

Run time means:

* PVM executing bytecode.
* Logical operations happening.

Example runtime errors:

```
division by zero
index out of range
null access
```

These occur DURING execution.

---

## Important Extra Concepts (Must Know)

### Python is Interpreted but Also Compiled

Reality:

* Python compiles to bytecode
* Then interprets via PVM

So calling Python “only interpreted” is incomplete.

---

### 🔹 .py vs .pyc

* `.py` → your source code
* `.pyc` → compiled bytecode

You can delete `.pyc` files safely; Python recreates them.

---

### Why Python Feels Slower than C++

Because:

* Bytecode runs inside PVM
* Extra abstraction layer exists
* Dynamic typing adds overhead

But development speed is much faster.
