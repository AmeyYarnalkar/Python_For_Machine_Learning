# Operators in Python 

Operators are special symbols used to **perform operations on data**.
They allow Python to do calculations, comparisons, and logical
decisions using variables and values.

Simple idea:

```
value1  operator  value2
```

Example:

```
5 + 3
```

Here `+` is the operator.

# Arithmetic Operators

Used for mathematical calculations.

| Operator | Meaning             | Example  |
| -------- | ------------------- | -------- |
| `+`      | Addition            | `5 + 2`  |
| `-`      | Subtraction         | `5 - 2`  |
| `*`      | Multiplication      | `5 * 2`  |
| `/`      | Division            | `5 / 2`  |
| `//`     | Floor Division      | `5 // 2` |
| `%`      | Modulus (remainder) | `5 % 2`  |
| `**`     | Power               | `2 ** 3` |

Example syntax:

```
a = 10
b = 3
print(a + b)
```

#  Comparison (Relational) Operators

Used to compare values.
They always return **True or False**.

| Operator | Meaning          |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| `==`     | Equal to         |
| `!=`     | Not equal        |
| `>`      | Greater than     |
| `<`      | Less than        |
| `>=`     | Greater or equal |
| `<=`     | Less or equal    |

Example:

```
x = 5
print(x > 3)
```

---

#  Assignment Operators

Used to assign or update values.

Basic:

```
x = 10
```

Combined assignment:

| Operator | Example  | Meaning   |
| -------- | -------- | --------- |
| `+=`     | `x += 2` | x = x + 2 |
| `-=`     | `x -= 2` | x = x - 2 |
| `*=`     | `x *= 2` | x = x * 2 |
| `/=`     | `x /= 2` | x = x / 2 |

---

#  Logical Operators

Used when working with conditions.

| Operator | Meaning                      |
| -------- | ---------------------------- |
| `and`    | Both conditions must be True |
| `or`     | At least one True            |
| `not`    | Reverses condition           |

Example:

```
age = 20
print(age > 18 and age < 30)
```

---

#  Identity Operators

Used to check if two variables refer to the **same object**.

| Operator | Meaning          |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| `is`     | Same object      |
| `is not` | Different object |

Example idea:

```
a = [1,2]
b = a
print(a is b)
```

---

#  Membership Operators

Used to check if a value exists inside a sequence.

| Operator | Meaning     |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `in`     | Present     |
| `not in` | Not present |

Example:

```
nums = [1,2,3]
print(2 in nums)
```

---

# 7️⃣ Bitwise Operators (Basic Idea)

Operate at binary level.

| Operator | Meaning     |    |
| -------- | ----------- | -- |
| `&`      | AND         |    |
| `l`         | OR          |    |
| `^`      | XOR         |    |
| `~`      | NOT         |    |
| `<<`     | Left shift  |    |
| `>>`     | Right shift |    |

Beginners don’t need deep detail yet.

# Operator Precedence (Order of Execution)

Python follows a priority order.

Simple memory rule:

```
()
**
*, /, //, %
+, -
comparisons
not
and
or
```

Example:

```
result = 2 + 3 * 4
```

Multiplication happens first.

---

# Important Beginner Notes

Operators work on objects, not raw memory values.
Same symbol can behave differently depending on data type.

Example:

```
"Hi" + "Jarvis"
```

This joins strings instead of adding numbers.
