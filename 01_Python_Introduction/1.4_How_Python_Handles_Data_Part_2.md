One important idea in Python data handling is how data **changes**
after it is created.

Some data can be modified directly.
Some data cannot be modified at all.

This is called:

👉 **Mutable** vs **Immutable** data.

## What is Immutable Data?

Immutable means:

Once the object is created, its value cannot be changed.

If you try to “modify” it, Python actually creates a **new object**
instead of changing the old one.

## Common Immutable Types

* int
* float
* bool
* str
* tuple

Example idea:

```
x = 10
x = x + 5
```

Python does NOT change 10 into 15.

Instead:

```
Old object 10 stays
New object 15 is created
x now points to new object
```

So immutable data never changes in place.

## What is Mutable Data?

Mutable means:

The object can be changed after creation.

Python modifies the same object in memory instead of creating a new one.

## Common Mutable Types

* list
* dict
* set
* most custom objects

Example idea:

```
nums = [1,2,3]
nums.append(4)
```

Python updates the existing list.
No new list object is created.

## Why Does Python Have Both?

This design gives balance:

Immutable data:

* Safer
* Predictable
* Easier for Python to optimize

Mutable data:

* Flexible
* Efficient when data needs frequent updates

---

## Visual Mental Model

Immutable:

```
x → 10
change value
x → 15   (new object created)
```

Mutable:

```
list → [1,2,3]
modify
same object → [1,2,3,4]
```
