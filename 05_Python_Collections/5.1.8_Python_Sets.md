## What Are Sets?

A **set** is a collection of **unique** items.

Main idea:

```
No duplicates allowed.
```

Example:

```python
numbers = {10, 20, 30}
```

If you try:

```python
numbers = {10, 20, 20, 30}
```

Python automatically keeps:

```
{10, 20, 30}
```

---

## How Sets Are Represented

Sets use **curly braces `{}`**.

```python
data = {1, 2, 3}
```

Important:

```
{}  → empty dictionary
set() → empty set
```

So to make empty set:

```python
s = set()
```

---

## When Should Sets Be Used?

Use sets when:

✔ You want **unique values only**
✔ You need **fast checking** if something exists
✔ Order doesn’t matter

Real uses:

* removing duplicates
* checking membership quickly
* comparing collections

Example:

```python
if 10 in numbers:
    print("exists")
```

---

## How Sets Look in Memory 

Sets use a **hash table**, similar to dictionaries.

Mental model:

```
Value → Hash → Memory position
```

Instead of storing items in order, Python spreads them across memory.

That’s why:

```
sets are unordered
```

And membership checking is fast.

# Properties of Sets

1. No duplicate values
2. Unordered (no index positions)
3. Mutable (you can add/remove items)
4. Elements must be immutable (no lists inside)

Allowed:

```
numbers, strings, tuples
```

Not allowed:

```
lists, dictionaries
```

## How to Create Sets

### Basic creation

```python
nums = {10, 20, 30}
print(nums)
```

### Empty set

```python
nums = set()
```

### Create from list

```python
nums = set([1,2,2,3])
print(nums)   # duplicates removed
```

---

## Adding and Updating Elements

## Add single element

```python
nums.add(40)
```

## Add multiple elements

```python
nums.update([50, 60])
```

`update()` takes any iterable (list, tuple, set).

---

## How to Access Elements

Sets do NOT support indexing.

This is wrong:

```python
nums[0]   # ERROR
```

Because sets are unordered.

Only way to check is:

```python
if 20 in nums:
    print("found")
```

---

## Deleting Elements

### Remove specific element

```python
nums.remove(20)
```

 Error if element not present.

---

### Safe remove

```python
nums.discard(20)
```

No error if missing.

---

### Remove random element

```python
nums.pop()
```

(Removes any item — not predictable.)

---

### Clear entire set

```python
nums.clear()
```

---

## How to Iterate Over Set

```python
nums = {10, 20, 30}

for item in nums:
    print(item)
```

Order may change each run — that’s normal.

---

## Bad Practices (Common Beginner Problems)

### Expecting order

```python
print(nums[0])   # doesn't work
```

Sets have no positions.

---

### Using set when duplicates matter

If duplicates are important → use list instead.

---

### Adding mutable objects

```python
nums.add([1,2])   # ERROR
```

---

### Modifying set while looping

```python
for x in nums:
    nums.remove(x)   # dangerous
```

---

## Best Practices

✔ Use sets to remove duplicates fast:

```python
unique = set(my_list)
```

✔ Use sets for fast membership checks.

✔ Prefer `discard()` instead of `remove()` when unsure.

✔ Use sets for mathematical operations:

```python
a = {1,2,3}
b = {3,4,5}

print(a & b)   # intersection
print(a | b)   # union
```
