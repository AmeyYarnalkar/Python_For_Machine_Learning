# What is Slicing in Python Lists?

**Slicing** means taking a **portion (a part)** of a list instead of the whole list.

Think of it like cutting a slice from a pizza, you don’t take everything, just a range.

---

## Basic Syntax

```python
list_name[start : end : step]
```

* **start** → where to begin (included)
* **end** → where to stop (NOT included)
* **step** → how many positions to jump (optional)

---

## Simple Examples

```python
nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
```

### Slice from index 1 to 3

```python
nums[1:4]
```

Result:

```
[20, 30, 40]
```

👉 Starts at index 1
👉 Stops BEFORE index 4

---

###  From start to a position

```python
nums[:3]
```

Result:

```
[10, 20, 30]
```

If start is missing → Python assumes `0`.

---

###  From a position to end

```python
nums[2:]
```

Result:

```
[30, 40, 50]
```

If end is missing → goes till last element.

---

### Copy entire list 

```python
nums[:]
```

Creates a new copy.

---

## Using Step

### Skip elements

```python
nums[0:5:2]
```

Result:

```
[10, 30, 50]
```

Step = 2 → jump every 2 elements.

---

### Reverse a list 

```python
nums[::-1]
```

Result:

```
[50, 40, 30, 20, 10]
```

Step = -1 means go backwards.

---

## Important Things Beginners Miss

✔ Slicing **does NOT change** the original list.
It creates a new list.

```python
new_list = nums[1:3]
```

Original stays same.

---

✔ End index is **exclusive** (not included).

---

##  When is Slicing Useful?

* Getting a part of data
* Reversing lists
* Copying lists
* Working with ranges in algorithms
