## What is a Dictionary in Python?

A **dictionary** stores data in **pairs**:

```
key  →  value
```

Example:

```python
student = {
    "name": "Amey",
    "age": 21,
    "marks": 90
}
```

Instead of positions like lists, dictionaries use **names (keys)** to access data.

---

## Structure of a Dictionary

General structure:

```python
{
    key1: value1,
    key2: value2,
    key3: value3
}
```

Visual idea:

```
{
 "name"  → "Amey",
 "age"   → 21,
 "marks" → 90
}
```

---

## What is a Key? (and its Properties)

A **key** is like a label or identifier.

Example:

```python
"name"
"age"
```

### Key properties:

Must be **unique** (no duplicates) \
Must be **immutable** (cannot change)

Allowed as keys:

```
string, number, tuple
```

Not allowed:

```
list, dictionary (because they change)
```

---

## What is a Value? (and its Properties)

A **value** is the actual data stored.

```python
"name": "Amey"
```

Here:

```
key   = "name"
value = "Amey"
```

Value properties:

Can be anything:

* number
* string
* list
* another dictionary
* boolean

Values **can repeat**.

## Purpose of a Dictionary

Use dictionary when:

✔ You want to **look up data using a name**, not position.\
✔ You want **fast searching**.\
✔ Data naturally has labels.

Real examples:

* user profile
* config settings
* JSON data
* database-like records

---

## When Should You Use Dictionary?

Use dict when:

✔ You need fast lookup (`O(1)` average)\
✔ Data is key → value relationship

Avoid when:

Order-based processing matters (use list)

---

## How Dictionary is Stored in Memory (Simple Idea)

Python dictionary uses something called a **hash table**.

Simple mental model:

```
Key → Hash function → Memory position → Value stored
```

> Imagine Hash function like a black boc which takes and generates a number for that key

Instead of scanning everything, Python jumps directly to the location.

That’s why:

```
student["name"]
```

is very fast.

---

## Creating a Dictionary

```python
# Method 1: Using {}
student = {"name": "Amey", "age": 21}

# Empty dictionary
data = {}

# Method 2: Using dict()
data2 = dict(name="Ram", age=20)
```

---

## Adding Elements

```python
student["city"] = "Pune"
```

If key doesn’t exist → it gets added.

---

## Updating an Element

```python
student["age"] = 22
```

If key exists → value changes.

---

## Can We Update a Key?

No.

Keys are immutable.

You must delete and recreate:

```python
student["new_key"] = student.pop("old_key")
```

---

## Deleting Elements

```python
# Remove using key
del student["age"]

# Remove and return value
student.pop("name")

# Remove all
student.clear()
```

---

## Getting Keys, Values, Pairs

```python
student.keys()    # all keys
student.values()  # all values
student.items()   # key-value pairs
```

---

## Iterating Over Dictionary

### Iterate keys

```python
for key in student:
    print(key)
```

### Iterate values

```python
for value in student.values():
    print(value)
```

### Iterate key-value pairs (BEST)

```python
for key, value in student.items():
    print(key, value)
```

---

## Can We Slice a Dictionary?

No.

Dictionaries do NOT support slicing.

Why?

Because dictionaries are not position-based — they are key-based.

---

## Common Mistakes Beginners Make

###  Accessing missing key

```python
student["phone"]   # ERROR if key not present
```

Better:

```python
student.get("phone")
```

---

### Using mutable types as keys

```python
my_dict[[1,2]] = "hello"   # WRONG
```

---

###  Assuming order matters

Even though modern Python keeps insertion order, don’t rely on it for logic unless necessary.

---

### Modifying dict while looping

```python
for key in student:
    del student[key]   # risky
```

---

# Best Practices

✔ Use meaningful keys:

```python
user_profile = {"username": "abc"}
```

✔ Use `.get()` to avoid crashes:

```python
student.get("age", 0)
```

✔ Use `.items()` when looping both key & value.

✔ Prefer dictionary for:

* config data
* mapping relationships
* counting frequency
