## What is Packing in Python?

**Packing** means:

👉 Putting multiple values into a single variable automatically.

Example:

```python
data = 10, 20, 30
print(data)
```

Output:

```
(10, 20, 30)
```

Python **packed** those values into a tuple.

Even without brackets, Python creates a tuple.

---

## Packing with Different Types

```python
numbers = 1, 2, 3
print(type(numbers))   # tuple
```

You can also pack inside lists or functions.

---

## What is Unpacking in Python?

**Unpacking** means:

👉 Taking values from a collection and assigning them to variables.

Example:

```python
point = (10, 20)

x, y = point

print(x)  # 10
print(y)  # 20
```

Python splits the tuple into separate variables.

---

## Basic Rule of Unpacking

Number of variables must match number of values.

Correct:

```python
a, b, c = (1, 2, 3)
```

Wrong:

```python
a, b = (1, 2, 3)   # ERROR
```

---

## Packing and Unpacking with Lists

Packing:

```python
data = [10, 20, 30]
```

Unpacking:

```python
a, b, c = data
print(a, b, c)
```

Works same as tuples.

---

## Extended Unpacking (`*` operator)

This is very useful.

Example:

```python
nums = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

a, *b = nums

print(a)  # 1
print(b)  # [2,3,4,5]
```

`*b` collects remaining values into a list.

---

### Another Example

```python
a, *middle, c = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

print(a)       # 1
print(middle)  # [2,3,4]
print(c)       # 5
```

---

## Packing and Unpacking in Loops

```python
pairs = [(1,2), (3,4), (5,6)]

for x, y in pairs:
    print(x, y)
```

Each tuple is unpacked automatically.

---


##  Common Mistakes

###  Variable count mismatch

```python
a, b = (1,2,3)   # ERROR
```

---

### Forgetting `*` in extended unpacking

```python
a, rest = (1,2,3,4)   # ERROR
```

---

###  Thinking unpacking works only for tuples

Works for:

```
list
tuple
set
dictionary keys
```

#  Best Practices

✔ Use unpacking to make code cleaner.

```python
x, y = point
```

instead of:

```python
x = point[0]
y = point[1]
```

---

✔ Use extended unpacking when size is unknown.

```python
first, *others = data
```

---

✔ Use unpacking in loops for readability.
